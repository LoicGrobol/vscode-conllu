# vscode language support for CoNLL-U

CoNLL-U is the treebank format used by the [Universal Dependencies project](universaldependencies.org).

This extension adds language support for it in vscode, using the grammar from the [Atom extension](https://atom.io/packages/language-conllu) and colours from [Rainbow cvs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv).

For now it is very basic, only providing distinct colours for the different columns. Nicer things to come hopefully.
